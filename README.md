### Description
"I developed and deployed an interactive web application called 'Beauty Products' for personalized product recommendations in the e-commerce space. This system utilizes multiple recommendation techniques to suggest items tailored to individual user preferences, enhancing the customer shopping experience

### Key Features
- Multiple Recommendation Strategies:

  - Rating-based: Recommends products with high customer ratings, making it easy for users to discover top-rated items.
  - Content-based: Analyzes product attributes such as category, brand, and description to suggest items similar to those the user has viewed or purchased.
  - Collaborative Filtering: Recommends products based on the purchase history of users with similar preferences.
  - Hybrid Approach: Combines different recommendation techniques to provide the most relevant and personalized suggestions.
- User-friendly Interface: Built using the Streamlit framework, the app features a simple, intuitive interface with a search bar and customizable recommendation settings. The interface displays recommended products, including images and relevant details.

- Example: A user can search for a specific product (e.g., nail polish), and the system will recommend similar products based on customer reviews, ratings, and product features.
