Title: Personalized Beauty Product Recommendations (Streamlit App)

Description:

I designed and deployed a web application for personalized beauty product recommendations using various techniques. The application, named "Beauty Products," caters to users seeking tailored suggestions based on their preferences.

Key Features:

Multiple Recommendation Strategies:
Rating-based: Recommends items with high user ratings, providing a solid starting point for new users.
Content-based: Analyzes product attributes like brand, ingredients, and category to suggest similar items based on user preferences or item similarities.
Collaborative Filtering: Identifies users with similar purchase histories and recommends products they've enjoyed.
Hybrid Approach: Combines the strengths of different recommendation methods for a more comprehensive and personalized experience.
Beautiful Interface: Streamlit framework was used to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
Example: By entering a specific nail polish name, the system recommends other nail polishes based on various user and product attributes.
Additional Information (Optional):

Briefly mention any specific libraries or frameworks used (e.g., pandas for data manipulation).
Highlight the project's scalability and potential for further development with machine learning or deep learning techniques.
Benefits:

Enhanced User Experience: Personalized recommendations help users discover relevant products, leading to a more satisfying shopping experience.
Increased Sales: By suggesting complementary items, the system encourages cross-selling and upselling opportunities.
Overall, this project showcases your ability to:

Understand and implement various recommendation system techniques.
Leverage web development frameworks to create a functional and visually appealing application.
Design a user-centric solution for a specific e-commerce domain.
Note:

Replace "Beauty Products" with your actual website name.
Consider adding a screenshot or short video showcasing your interface (optional).
