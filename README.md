Title: Personalized Beauty Product Recommendations (Streamlit App)

### Description
I designed and deployed a web application, Beauty Products, for personalized beauty product recommendations. The app caters to users seeking tailored suggestions based on their preferences using various recommendation techniques.

### Key Features
- Multiple Recommendation Strategies:

  - Rating-based: Recommends items with high user ratings, ideal for new users.
  - Content-based: Analyzes product attributes like brand, ingredients, and category to suggest similar items.
  - Collaborative Filtering: Identifies users with similar purchase histories and recommends products theyâ€™ve enjoyed.
  - Hybrid Approach: Combines the strengths of different methods for a more personalized experience.
- Beautiful Interface: Created with the Streamlit framework for a user-friendly and visually appealing experience.

- Example: By entering a specific product name (e.g., nail polish), the system recommends other similar items based on product attributes and user preferences.



Briefly mention any specific libraries or frameworks used (e.g., pandas for data manipulation).

Benefits:

Enhanced User Experience: Personalized recommendations help users discover relevant products, leading to a more satisfying shopping experience.

Leverage web development frameworks to create a functional and visually appealing application.
Design a user-centric solution for a specific e-commerce domain.
